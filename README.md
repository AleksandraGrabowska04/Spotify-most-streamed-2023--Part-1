# ðŸŽ¶Spotify-most-streamed-2023--Part-1ðŸŽ¶
ðŸ‘‰This project aims to analyse characteristics of the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023 and predict the most streamed songs in 2024, aiming to uncover their key musical characteristics. By employing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, as well as TensorFlow and model from libary statsmodels in order to build models for predictions and analysis ðŸ¤–, I'll explore features like number of artists involved, streams count, bpm danceability, valence, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness and speechiness. The analysis is conducted using the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023" dataset sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023/data). The goal is to provide insights into the factors driving song popularity. Additionally, I'll investigate the relationship between these musical attributes and how they influence each other.

ðŸ‘‰This is the first part of the project. The second part will involve building a model that, based on data about the most popular songs from 2023, will attempt to predict which songs will be popular in 2024. The final results of the second part will be available on my GitHub (https://github.com/AleksandraGrabowska04) in January 2025 when the list of hits from 2024 will be published. Only then will it be possible to verify my predictions and write a complete documentation for the second part of the project.
