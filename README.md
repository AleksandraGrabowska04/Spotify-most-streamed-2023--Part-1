# ðŸŽ¶Spotify-most-streamed-2023--Part-1ðŸŽ¶

ðŸ‘‰This project aims to analyze the characteristics of the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023 and use them to train a model to predict whether the most streamed songs of 2024 will also be classified as popular, effectively testing the model's accuracy. By employing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and the statsmodels library for analysis and model building ðŸ¤–, I will explore features such as the number of artists involved, stream count, bpm, danceability, valence, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, and speechiness.
The analysis utilizes the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023" dataset sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023/data), with the goal of uncovering the key factors driving song popularity and examining how these musical attributes influence each other.

ðŸ‘‰This is the first part of the project. The second part will involve building and testing the predictive model. By leveraging the patterns identified in the 2023 data, the model will evaluate its ability to predict the popularity of 2024 hits. The results and complete documentation for this second phase will be published on my GitHub (https://github.com/AleksandraGrabowska04) as soon as the list of hits from 2024 and their characterisctics becomes available. This final step will determine the accuracy of the predictions and conclude the project.
